Personal Security Dashboard:
Personal Security Dashboard
Objective

Develop a web-based dashboard to monitor and manage your personal cybersecurity. 
The dashboard will provide insights into your network security, system vulnerabilities, and password strength, and offer recommendations for improving your security.
Features

    Network Monitoring:
        Display real-time information about your network traffic.
        Alert you to any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

    Vulnerability Scanning:
        Integrate a vulnerability scanner (like OpenVAS or a simple script) to check for common vulnerabilities on your system.
        Provide a report of the scan results with recommendations for remediation.

    Password Strength Analyzer:
        Implement a tool to analyze the strength of your passwords.
        Suggest improvements based on best practices (length, complexity, etc.).

    System Health Check:
        Monitor system logs for any unusual activities.
        Display status reports on system updates, software versions, and security patches.

    Alerts and Notifications:
        Set up notifications for important security events, such as failed login attempts or new software installations.

    Educational Resources:
        Include links and resources on best practices for cybersecurity, such as secure password creation and avoiding phishing attacks.

Technologies to Use

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic UI).
    Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or any language youâ€™re comfortable with.
    Database: MySQL or MongoDB to store scan results, configuration settings, and logs.
    Tools: Integration with security tools like Nmap, OpenVAS, or custom scripts for scanning and monitoring.
    Deployment: Host your dashboard on a cloud provider or a local server.

Steps to Get Started

    Plan Your Dashboard: Define the features you want and create a wireframe or mockup of the dashboard.
    Set Up the Environment: Install and configure your development tools and frameworks.
    Develop the Backend: Implement features like network monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and database management.
    Build the Frontend: Design the user interface and connect it to your backend services.
    Test and Refine: Test your dashboard for functionality and security. Refine it based on feedback and observations.
    Deploy and Maintain:Regular update to address any new security concerns or feature enhancements.
